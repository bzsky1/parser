# Parser
This program is created to collect information from the site.

The program collects the name of the items, their price, a link to the product and a link to the image and downloads it into a file in the csv format. The program provides the ability to determine the number of pages from which you want to collect information. The program has a pause between pages in order to reduce the possibility of detecting that it is a program. 
In the future, the program will be able to manually enter the name of the file in the terminal where to collect information and the number of seconds of pause between pages when collecting information.
