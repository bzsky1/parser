# Parser
This program is created to collect information from the site.

The program collects the name of the items, their price, a link to the product and a link to the image and downloads it into a file in the csv format. The program provides the ability to determine the number of pages from which you want to collect information. The program has a pause between pages in order to reduce the possibility of detecting that it is a program. In this version of the program, the file name is entered manually upon request from the terminal, and the number of seconds of pause when turning the pages of the site is also manually entered.
